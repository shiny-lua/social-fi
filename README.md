# Social Fi

SocialFi is flipping the script on social networking! Forget just friending someone – now you can turn your connections into something way cooler: "Keys." Imagine literally investing in your friends’ social clout or backing a squad just to show how trustworthy they are. It's like buying stock in popularity! Picture a world where everyone’s flexing their social Keys – I mean, who wouldn’t want to be a part of that global trust-fest?

## Key Features

The cost of each key is solely determined by the total number of keys already in circulation. As the number of keys increases, the price of each key rises.

The formula for the price is as follows:
Key Price = (number of keys)² * 2 / 7.

It’s important to take into account slippage and fees when engaging in buying or selling transactions.
